  -- | These combinators are specific to parser combinators. In one way or another, they influence
  -- how a parser consumes input, or under what conditions a parser does or does not fail. These are
  -- really important for most practical parsing considerations, although lookAhead is much less
  -- well used.
    atomic, lookAhead, notFollowedBy, eof,
  -- * Consumptionless Parsers
  -- | These combinators and parsers do not consume input: they are the most primitive ways of
  -- producing successes and failures with the minimal possible effect on the parse. They are,
  -- however, reasonably useful; in particular, `pure` and `unit` can be put to good use in
  -- injecting results into a parser without needing to consume anything, or mapping another parser.

  -- different type. This new result value may or may not be derived from the previous result.

    (<$>), (<$), void,
  -- * Sequencing Combinators
  -- | These combinators all combine two parsers in sequence. The first argument of the combinator
  -- will be executed first, then the second argument second. The results of both parsers are
  -- combined in some way (depending on the individual combinator). If one of the parsers fails, the
  -- combinator as a whole fails.
    (<~>), (<:>),
    (<*>), liftA2, (*>), (<*), (<**>),
  -- * Branching Combinators
  -- | These combinators allow for parsing one alternative or another. All of these combinators are
  -- /left-biased/, which means that the left-hand side of the combinator is tried first: the
  -- right-hand side of the combinator will only be tried when the left-hand one failed (and did not
  -- consume input in the process).
    (<+>),
    (<|>), 
  -- * Selective Combinators
  -- | These combinators will decide which branch to take next based on the result of another parser.
  -- This differs from combinators like `(<|>)` which make decisions based on the success/failure of
  -- a parser: here the result of a /successful/ parse will direct which option is done.

  -- * Filtering Combinators
  -- | These combinators perform filtering on the results of a parser. This means that, given the
  -- result of a parser, they will perform some function on that result, and the success of that
  -- function effects whether or not the parser fails.
    filterS, mapMaybeS,

  -- * Folding Combinators
  {-| These combinators repeatedly execute a parser (at least zero or one times depending on the
  -- specific combinator) until it fails. The results of the successes are then combined together
  -- using a folding function. An initial value for the accumulation may be given (for the folds),
  -- or the first successful result is the initial accumulator (for the reduces). These are
  -- implemented efficiently and do not need to construct any intermediate list with which to store
  -- the results.

Runs a parser against some input.

Given a parser, some input, and a way of producing parse errors of a desired
type (via 'ErrorBuilder'), this function runs a parser to produce either a
successful result or an error. Note that the @err@ type parameter is first,
which allows for @parse \@String@ to make use of the defaultly formated @String@
error messages. This may not be required if it is clear from context. To make
this process nicer within GHCi, consider using 'parseRepl'.

{-|
Runs a parser against some input, pretty-printing the result to the terminal.

Compared, with 'parse', this function will always generate error messages as
strings and will print them nicely to the terminal (on multiple lines). If the
parser succeeds, the result will also be printed to the terminal. This is useful
for playing around with parsers in GHCi, seeing the results more clearly.

Runs a parser against some input obtained from a given file.

Given a parser, a filename, and a way of producing parse errors of a desired
type (via 'ErrorBuilder'), this function runs a parser to produce either a
successful result or an error. First, input is collected by reading the file,
and then the result is returned within `IO`; the filename is forwarded on to
the 'ErrorBuilder', which may mean it forms part of the generated error messages.

Note that the @err@ type parameter is first,
which allows for @parseFromFile \@String@ to make use of the defaultly formated @String@
error messages. This may not be required if it is clear from context.

{-|
This combinator parses its argument @p@, but rolls back any consumed input on failure.

If the parser @p@ succeeds, then @atomic p@ has no effect. However, if @p@ failed,
then any input that it consumed is rolled back. This has two uses: it ensures that
the parser @p@ is all-or-nothing when consuming input, and it allows for
parsers that consume input to backtrack when they fail (with '(<|>)'). It should be
used for the latter purpose sparingly, however, since excessive backtracking in a
parser can result in much lower efficiency.

==== __Examples__
>>> parse (string "abc" <|> string "abd") "abd"
Failure .. -- first parser consumed a, so no backtrack
>>> parse (atomic (string "abc") <|> string "abd") "abd"
Success "abd" -- first parser does not consume input on failure now

@since 0.1.0.0
-}
atomic :: Parsec a -- ^ the parser, @p@, to execute, if it fails, it will not have consumed input.
       -> Parsec a -- ^ a parser that tries @p@, but never consumes input if it fails.
atomic (Parsec p) = Parsec $ \st ok bad -> p st ok (\err _ -> bad err st)

{-| This combinator parses its argument @p@, but does not consume input if it succeeds.

If the parser @p@ succeeds, then @lookAhead p@ will roll back any input consumed
whilst parsing @p@. If @p@ fails, however, then the whole combinator fails and
any input consumed __remains consumed__. If this behaviour is not desirable,
consider pairing `lookAhead` with `atomic`.

==== __Examples__
>>> parse (lookAhead (string "aaa") *> string "aaa") "aaa"
Success "aaa"
>>> parse (lookAhead (string "abc") <|> string "abd" "abd"
Failure .. -- lookAhead does not roll back input consumed on failure

@since 0.1.0.0
-}
lookAhead :: Parsec a -- ^ the parser, @p@, to execute
          -> Parsec a -- ^ a parser that parses @p@ and never consumes input if it succeeds.
lookAhead (Parsec p) = Parsec $ \st ok err -> p st (\x _ -> ok x st) err

{-|
This combinator parses its argument @p@, and succeeds when @p@ fails and vice-versa, never consuming
input.

If the parser @p@ succeeds, then @notFollowedBy p@ will fail, consuming no input.
Otherwise, should @p@ fail, then @notFollowedBy p@ will succeed, consuming no input
and returning @()@.

==== __Examples__
One use for this combinator is to allow for \"longest-match\" behaviour.
For instance, keywords are normally only considered keywords if they are not
part of some larger valid identifier (i.e. the keyword \"if\" should not parse
successfully given \"ifp\"). This can be accomplished as follows:

> keyword :: String -> Parsec ()
> keyword kw = atomic $ string kw *> notFollowedBy letterOrDigit

@since 0.1.0.0
-}
notFollowedBy :: Parsec a  -- ^ the parser, @p@, to execute, it must fail in order for this combinator to succeed.
              -> Parsec () -- ^ a parser which fails when @p@ succeeds and succeeds otherwise, never consuming input.
notFollowedBy (Parsec p) = Parsec $ \st ok bad ->
  p st (\_ st' -> let !width = Internal.consumed st' - Internal.consumed st
                  in Internal.useHints bad (Internal.expectedErr st Set.empty width) st)
       (\_ _ -> ok () st)

-- eof is usually `notFollowedBy item`, but this requires annoying cyclic dependencies on Char
{-| This parser only succeeds at the end of the input.

Equivalent to `notFollowedBy(item)`.

==== __Examples__
>>> parse eof "a"
Failure ..
>>> parse eof ""
Success ()

@since 0.1.0.0
-}
eof :: Parsec ()
eof = Parsec $ \st good bad -> case Internal.input st of
  (:){} -> Internal.useHints bad
             (Internal.expectedErr st (Set.singleton Internal.ExpectEndOfInput) 1) st
  []    -> good () st

{-|
This parser produces @()@ without having any other effect.

When this parser is ran, no input is required, nor consumed, and the given value will always be
successfully returned. It has no other effect on the state of the parser.

{-|
This combinator, pronounced "zip", first parses @p@ then parses @q@: 
if both succeed the result of @p@ is paired with that of @q@.

First, runs @p@, yielding @x@ on success, then runs @q@, yielding @y@ on success. 
If both are successful then @(x, y)@ is returned. 
If either fail then the entire combinator fails.

==== __Examples__
>>> p = char 'a' <~> char 'b'
>>> parse p "ab"
Success ('a', 'b')
>>> parse p "b"
Failure ..
>>> parse p "a"
Failure ..

{-|
This combinator, pronounced "as", replaces the result of the given parser, ignoring the old result.

Similar to @(<$>)@, except the old result of the given parser is not required to
compute the new result. This is useful when the result is a constant value (or function!).
Functionally the same as @p *> pure x@ or @const x <$> p@.

/In [scala parsley](https:\/\/j-mie6.github.io\/parsley\/), this combinator is known as /@#>@/ or /'@as@'.

Success true

($>) = flip (<$)

{-|
This combinator, pronounced "cons", first parses @p@ and then @ps@: if both succeed the result of this
parser is prepended onto the result of @ps@.

First, runs @p@, yielding @x@ on success, then runs @ps@, yielding @xs@ on success. 
If both are successful then @x : xs@ is returned. 
If either fail then the entire combinator fails.

==== __Examples__

                    -- and prepends the result of the former onto that of the latter.
(<:>) = liftA2 (:)

infixl 3 <+>
{-|
This combinator, pronounced "sum", wraps the given parser's result in @Left@ if it succeeds, and parses @q@ if it failed __without__ consuming input,
wrapping the result in @Right@.

If the given parser @p@ is successful, then its result is wrapped up using @Left@ and no further action is taken.
Otherwise, if @p@ fails __without__ consuming input, then @q@ is parsed instead and its result is
wrapped up using @Right@.
If @p@ fails having consumed input, this combinator fails.
This is functionally equivalent to @Left <$> p <|> Right <$> q@.

The reason for this behaviour is that it prevents space leaks and improves error messages. 
If this behaviour is not desired, use @atomic p@ to rollback any input consumed on failure.

==== __Examples__
>>> p = string "abc" <+> char "xyz"
>>> parse p "abc"
Success (Left "abc")
>>> parse p "xyz"
Success (Right "xyz")
>>> parse p "ab"
Failure .. -- first parser consumed an 'a'!

      -> Parsec (Either a b) -- ^ a parser which either parses @p@, or @q@, projecting their 
                             -- results into an 'Either'.

The given parser @p@ will continue to be parsed until it fails having __not consumed__ input.
All of the results generated by the successful parses are then combined in a left-to-right
fashion using the function @f@: the left-most value provided to @f@ is the value @k@.

If @p@ does fail at any point having consumed input, this combinator will fail.

{-|
This combinator acts like the 'foldMap' function but with a parser.

The parser @manyMap f p@, will parse @p@ __zero__ or more times, then
adapt each result with the function @f@ to produce a bunch of values
in some 'Monoid' @m@. These values are then combined together to form a
single value; if @p@ could not be parsed, it will return the 'mempty'
for @m@.

This combinator filters the result of the given parser @p@ using the given predicate, 
succeeding only if the predicate returns @True@.

First, parse @p@. 
If it succeeds then take its result @x@ and apply it to the predicate @pred@. 
If @pred x@ is true, then return @x@. 
Otherwise, the combinator fails.

This combinator applies a function @f@ to the result of the given parser @p@:

Repeatedly parse the given parser __one__ or more times, collecting the results into a list.

Parses the given parser @p@ repeatedly until it fails. 
If @p@ failed having consumed input, this combinator fails. 
Otherwise, when @p@ fails __without consuming input__, this combinator will return all of the results, 
@x₁@ through @xₙ@ (with @n@ >= 1), in a 'List': @[x₁, .., xₙ]@. 
If @p@ was not successful at least one time, this combinator fails.

/See Also:/ 'Text.Gigaparsec.Combinator.NonEmpty.some' for a version of this combinator which 
returns a 'Data.List.NonEmpty' list of results.

Given the parsers @p@ and @q@, this combinator parses @p@; 
if @p@ fails __without consuming input__, it then parses @q@.

If @p@ is successful, then this combinator is successful and no further action is taken. 
Otherwise, if @p@ fails without consuming input, then @q@ is parsed instead. 
If @p@ (or @q@) fails having consumed input, this combinator fails.

This behaviour prevents space leaks and improves error messages. 
If this is not desired, use @atomic p@ to rollback any input consumed on failure in the first branch.

This combinator is /associative/, meaning that:

prop> (p <|> q) <|> r = p <|> (q <|> r)

Given parsers @p@ and @f@, this combinator, pronounced "reverse ap", first parses @p@ then parses @f@: 
if both succeed then returns the result of @f@ to that of @p@.

First, runs @p@, yielding a value x on success, then @f@ is ran, yielding a function @g@ on success. 
If both are successful, then @g(x)@ is returned. 
If either fail then the entire combinator fails.

Compared with '<*>', this combinator is useful for left-factoring: 
when two branches of a parser share a common prefix, this can often be factored out; 
but the result of that factored prefix may be required to help generate the results of each branch. 
In this case, the branches can return functions that, when given the factored result, 
can produce the original results from before the factoring.

This combinator parses its first argument @p@, then parses @q@ only if @p@ returns a Left.

First, parse @p@, which, if successful, will produce either a @Left x@ or a @Right y@:
