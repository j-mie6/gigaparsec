Module      : Text.Gigaparsec.Char
Description : Contains the combinators needed to read characters and strings, as well as combinators
              to match specific sub-sets of characters.

Maintainer  : Jamie Willis, Gigaparsec Maintainers
Stability   : stable

This module contains many parsers to do with reading one or more characters. Almost every parser
will need something from this module.

In particular, this module contains: combinators that can read specific characters; combinators that
represent character classes and their negations; combinators for reading specific strings; as well
as a selection of pre-made parsers to parse specific kinds of character, like digits and letters.

  -- | These are the most primitive combinators for consuming input capable of any input reading tasks.

  -- * Character Class Combinators
  -- | These combinators allow for working with /character classes/. This means that a set, or range,
  -- of characters can be specified, and the combinator will return a parser that matches one of
  -- those characters (or conversely, any character that is /not/ in that set). The parsed character

  -- strings. They are united in all returning `String` as their result.

This combinator tries to parse a single character from the input that matches the given predicate.

Attempts to read a character from the input and tests it against the predicate @pred@. If a character
@c@ can be read and @pred c@ is true, then @c@ is consumed and returned. Otherwise, no input is
consumed and this combinator will fail.

==== __Examples__
>>> parse @String (satisfy Data.Char.isDigit) ""
Failure ..
>>> parse @String (satisfy Data.Char.isDigit) "7"
Success '7'
>>> parse @String (satisfy Data.Char.isDigit) "a5"
Failure ..

Roughly speaking:

@
char c = satisfy (== c)
@

satisfy :: (Char -> Bool) -- ^ the predicate, @pred@, to test the next character against, should one
                          -- exist.
        -> Parsec Char    -- ^ a parser that tries to read a single character @c@, such that @pred c@
                          -- is true, or fails.
satisfy = _satisfy Set.empty

-- Needs to be primitive for the raw expected item down the line
{-|
This combinator tries to parse a single specific character @c@ from the input.

Attempts to read the given character @c@ from the input stream at the current position. If this
character can be found, it is consumed and returned. Otherwise, no input is consumed and this
combinator will fail.

==== __Examples__
>>> parse @String (char 'a') ""
Failure ..
>>> parse @String (char 'a') "a"
Success 'a'
>>> parse @String (char 'a') "ba"
Failure ..

@since 0.1.0.0
-}
char :: Char        -- ^ the character to parse, @c@.
     -> Parsec Char -- ^ a parser that tries to read a single @c@, or fails.
char c = _satisfy (Set.singleton (Internal.ExpectRaw (pure c))) (== c)

-- Needs to be primitive for the raw expected item and wide caret down the line
{-|
This combinator attempts to parse a given string from the input, and fails otherwise.

Attempts to read the given string /completely/ from the input at the current position.
If the string is present, then the parser succeeds, and the entire string is consumed
from the input. Otherwise, if the input has too few characters remaining, or not all
the characters matched, the parser fails. On failure, __all__ the characters that were
matched are consumed from the input.

==== __Examples__
>>> parse @String (string "abc") ""
Failure ..
>>> parse @String (string "abc") "abcd"
Success "abc"
>>> parse @String (string "abc") "xabc"
Failure ..

==== Notes
* The error messages generated by `string` do not reflect how far into the input it managed
  to get: this is because the error being positioned at the start of the string is more
  natural. However, input __will__ still be consumed for purposes of backtracking.

-- Composite Combinators
-------------------------------------------------

-- Could be optimised to remove the partiality
{-|
This combinator tries to parse and process a character from the input if it is defined for the given function.

Attempts to read a character from the input and tests to see if it is in the domain of @f@. If a character
@c@ can be read and @f c@ returns a @Just@, then @c@ is consumed and @Just (f c)@ is returned. Otherwise,
no input is consumed and this combinator will fail.

==== __Examples__
>>> let digit = satisfyMap (\c -> if isDigit c then Just (digitToInt c) else Nothing)
>>> parse @String digit ""
Failure ..
>>> parse @String digit "7"
Success 7
>>> parse @String digit "a5"
Failure ..

-- Use RangeSet internally?
-- the labelling here should be consistent with raw characters, not sure how

{-|
This combinator tries to parse any character from supplied set of characters @cs@, returning it if
successful.

If the next character in the input is a member of the set @cs@, it is consumed and returned.
Otherwise, no input is consumed and the combinator fails.

==== __Examples__

Success 'c'

This combinator tries to parse any character __not__ from supplied set of characters @cs@,
returning it if successful.

If the next character in the input is not a member of the set @cs@, it is consumed and returned.
Otherwise, no input is consumed and the combinator fails.

{-|
This combinator parses characters matching the given predicate __zero__ or more times, collecting
the results into a string.

Repeatly reads characters that satisfy the given predicate @pred@. When no more characters
can be successfully read, the results are stitched together into a @String@ and returned.
This combinator can never fail, since @satisfy@ can never fail having consumed input.

==== __Examples__
>>> let ident = letter <:> stringOfMany isAlphaNum
>>> parse @String ident "abdc9d"
Success "abdc9d"
>>> parse @String ident "a"
Success "a"
>>> parse @Stringr ident "9"
Failure ..

==== Notes
* this acts exactly like @stringOfMany (satisfy pred)@, but may be more efficient.
* analogous to the @megaparsec@ @takeWhileP@ combinator.

@since 0.1.0.0
-}
stringOfMany :: (Char -> Bool) -- ^ the predicate, @pred@, to test characters against.

{-|
This combinator parses characters matching the given predicate __one__ or more times, collecting
the results into a string.

Repeatly reads characters that satisfy the given predicate @pred@. When no more characters
can be successfully read, the results are stitched together into a @String@ and returned.
This combinator can never fail having consumed input, since @satisfy@ can never fail having

{-|
This combinator tries to parse each of the strings @strs@, until one of them succeeds.

Unlike `Text.Gigaparsec.Combinator.choice`, this combinator will not necessarily parse the strings in the
order provided. It will avoid strings that have another string as a prefix first, so that it has
/Longest Match/ semantics. It will try to minimise backtracking too, making it a much more efficient
option than @choice . map atomic@.

The longest succeeding string will be returned. If no strings match then the combinator fails.

==== __Examples__
>>> let p = strings (Set.fromList ["hell", "hello", "goodbye", "g", "abc"])
>>> parse @String p "hell"
Success "hell"
>>> parse @String p "hello"
Success "hello"
>>> parse @String p "good"
Success "g"
>>> parse @String p "goodbye"
Success "goodbye"
>>> parse @String p "a"

-- Departure from original naming, but no overloading, so oh well
{-|
This combinator tries to parse each of the key-value pairs @kvs@, until one of them succeeds.

Each key-value pair in the map provided to this combinator is a string and a parser to perform if
that string can be parsed. Keys that are a prefix of another key are avoided, so that the parser
overall has /Longest Match/ semantics. It will try and minimise backtracking too, making it an
efficient option.

==== __Examples__
>>> let p = trie $ Map.fromList [ ("hell", pure 4)
                                , ("hello", pure 5)
                                , ("goodbye", pure 7)
                                , ("g", pure 1)
                                , ("abc", pure 3)
                                ]

Success 4
>>> parse @String p "hello"
Success 5
>>> parse @String p "good"
Success 1
>>> parse @String p "goodbye"
Success 7
>>> parse @String p "a"
Failure ..

==== Notes
* The scope of any backtracking performed is isolated to the key itself, as it is assumed
  that once a key parses correctly, the branch has been committed to. Putting an `atomic`
  around the values will not affect this behaviour.
